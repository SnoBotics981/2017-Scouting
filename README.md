# Scouting
Our scouting software should be stored here. Documents releating to scouting are on the team's google drive.

# Dependencies
This software depends on JInput. The exact build that is being used can be found here: http://ci.newdawnsoftware.com/job/JInput/2841/
After downloading the library, you will want to copy everything from the "dist" folder to a location where you will be using it.
